## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Through this project,

## 1.

I've learnt how to avoid using 'media-query' for responsive design by using 'max-width'.

## 2.

Easy way to center divs using 'CSS Grid'.

**Some of the Code I'm proud Of**

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="container__qr">
    <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code" />
  </div>
  <div class="container__text">
    <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
    <p>
      Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to
      the next level
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

For future, my plans are to learn cool animations with CSS, as for now I'm totally comfortable with making layouts. For further development, I'm looking forward to use more Semantic HTML & CSS to make code little more clean
